# descant — the complete manifest (the parameter document)

**Purpose.** Grows a personal learning tree: goals and lessons in the Hoard (`files.read`, `files.write`, `search.query`), lessons run (`play.catalogue`, `play.run`), credentials signed by a teacher and checked (`web4.verify`).

**Matrix layer 397 · icon group L3 · wave spec `wave33/397-descant.md`.**

## The manifest: the parts the pattern library already makes correct

Every line below is FINAL — the provides, the body and the check are the
library's verified implementations. Emit them exactly.

## The app-specific entries — SPELLED OUT TO THE LETTER

These are the entries the library does not cover. Each one below
gives the exact `provides` line, the runtime, the body's required
shape (from the real blocks) and the exact check. Write the body;
nothing else is yours to decide.

### Entry 1 — - `credential_ok`: (critical) "issue this credential" (every required skill mastered AND a teacher signed) in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed

**The clause it implements.** - `credential_ok`: (critical) "issue this credential" (every required skill mastered AND a teacher signed) in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
