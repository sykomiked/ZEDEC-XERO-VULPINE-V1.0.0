# collet — the complete manifest (the parameter document)

**Purpose.** locks sensitive data in escrow that opens only under agreed rules, such as two keyholders or a set date (`recovery.setup`, `recovery.status`, `recovery.approve`, `recovery.veto`, `files.cross`, `journal.query`).

**Matrix layer 309 · icon group L3 · wave spec `wave26/309-collet.md`.**

## The manifest: the parts the pattern library already makes correct

Every line below is FINAL — the provides, the body and the check are the
library's verified implementations. Emit them exactly.

## The app-specific entries — SPELLED OUT TO THE LETTER

These are the entries the library does not cover. Each one below
gives the exact `provides` line, the runtime, the body's required
shape (from the real blocks) and the exact check. Write the body;
nothing else is yours to decide.

### Entry 1 — `policies` tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**The clause it implements.** `policies` tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic c <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```
