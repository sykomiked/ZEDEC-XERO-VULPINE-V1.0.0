# reckoner — the complete manifest (the parameter document)

**Purpose.** period statements and tax estimates from the books (`ledger.entries`, `ledger.check`, `iso20022.render` camt.053, `jurisdiction.get`), saved through the Banker (`files.write`).

**Matrix layer 83 · icon group L1 · wave spec `wave2/083-reckoner.md`.**

## The manifest: the parts the pattern library already makes correct

Every line below is FINAL — the provides, the body and the check are the
library's verified implementations. Emit them exactly.

## The app-specific entries — SPELLED OUT TO THE LETTER

These are the entries the library does not cover. Each one below
gives the exact `provides` line, the runtime, the body's required
shape (from the real blocks) and the exact check. Write the body;
nothing else is yours to decide.

### Entry 1 — "report allowed" (closed period, `ledger.check` ok) in eve. Books verification is shown as `ledger.check` returns it

**The clause it implements.** "report allowed" (closed period, `ledger.check` ok) in eve. Books verification is shown as `ledger.check` returns it

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic c <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 2 — Tax figures are advisory, not tax advice

**The clause it implements.** Tax figures are advisory, not tax advice

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic sutra <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 3 — a person files

**The clause it implements.** a person files

**Runtime.** `trebago` — the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic trebago <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```
