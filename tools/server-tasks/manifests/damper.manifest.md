# damper — the complete manifest (the parameter document)

**Purpose.** watches heat, smoke and power readings (`sys.info`, `power.status`, `log.tail`, `journal.query`) and coordinates alarms and evacuation contacts (`phone.list`, `call.start` on the person's request, `place.here`). zxvd has no method for home heat and smoke sensor readings, notice post: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

**Matrix layer 174 · icon group L2 · wave spec `wave14/174-damper.md`.**

## The manifest: the parts the pattern library already makes correct

Every line below is FINAL — the provides, the body and the check are the
library's verified implementations. Emit them exactly.

## The app-specific entries — SPELLED OUT TO THE LETTER

These are the entries the library does not cover. Each one below
gives the exact `provides` line, the runtime, the body's required
shape (from the real blocks) and the exact check. Write the body;
nothing else is yours to decide.

### Entry 1 — sensor grid (room by sensor) in APL as KRON

**The clause it implements.** sensor grid (room by sensor) in APL as KRON

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic c <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 2 — building tree (floors, rooms, exits) in MUMPS as MYRA

**The clause it implements.** building tree (floors, rooms, exits) in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic sutra <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```
