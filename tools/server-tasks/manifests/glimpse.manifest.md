# glimpse — the complete manifest (the parameter document)

**Purpose.** capture the screen, a window or a region, record the screen; save into the Hoard with `files.write` ("Screenshot N.png", first free N from `files.list`); cut recordings with `stream.plan`. zxvd has no display-capture method: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

**Matrix layer 111 · icon group L1 · wave spec `wave9/111-glimpse.md`.**

## The manifest: the parts the pattern library already makes correct

Every line below is FINAL — the provides, the body and the check are the
library's verified implementations. Emit them exactly.

## The app-specific entries — SPELLED OUT TO THE LETTER

These are the entries the library does not cover. Each one below
gives the exact `provides` line, the runtime, the body's required
shape (from the real blocks) and the exact check. Write the body;
nothing else is yours to decide.

### Entry 1 — first free N from the used numbers vector in kron

**The clause it implements.** first free N from the used numbers vector in kron

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic c <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```
