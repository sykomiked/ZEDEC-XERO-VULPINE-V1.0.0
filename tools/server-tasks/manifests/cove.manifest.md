# cove — the complete manifest (the parameter document)

**Purpose.** only between devices on the owner's roster (`devmesh.devices`, `devmesh.status`); frames sealed and opened with `ehop.seal`, `ehop.open` on a band from `ehop.bands`. No carrier is wired to the socket (H7): use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

**Matrix layer 32 · icon group L1 · wave spec `wave5/032-cove.md`.**

## The manifest: the parts the pattern library already makes correct

Every line below is FINAL — the provides, the body and the check are the
library's verified implementations. Emit them exactly.

## The app-specific entries — SPELLED OUT TO THE LETTER

These are the entries the library does not cover. Each one below
gives the exact `provides` line, the runtime, the body's required
shape (from the real blocks) and the exact check. Write the body;
nothing else is yours to decide.

### Entry 1 — "may this tunnel open" (both devices active, neither revoked) in eve + kron witnessed

**The clause it implements.** "may this tunnel open" (both devices active, neither revoked) in eve + kron witnessed

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic c <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 2 — nonce discipline (seq strictly rising per channel, refusal on reuse or overflow) in sutra + Rust wasm witnessed

**The clause it implements.** nonce discipline (seq strictly rising per channel, refusal on reuse or overflow) in sutra + Rust wasm witnessed

**Runtime.** `eve` — the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic eve <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```
