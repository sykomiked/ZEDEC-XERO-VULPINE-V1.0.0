# granary — the complete manifest (the parameter document)

**Purpose.** the model slot (`model.info`), room on disk (`sys.disk`), energy (`power.status`). Downloading a model and reading its licence have no method: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

**Matrix layer 64 · icon group L1 · wave spec `wave7/064-granary.md`.**

## The manifest: the parts the pattern library already makes correct

Every line below is FINAL — the provides, the body and the check are the
library's verified implementations. Emit them exactly.

```zxapp
zxapp 1

needs sys.read
needs fs.read
needs fs.write

provides flags_none truth bits forbidden
provides composite_key num high low

.
logic kron composite_key <<

.
check flags_none bits=0,1,2,3 forbidden=1,1,1,1 = true,false,true,false
check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999
```

## The app-specific entries — SPELLED OUT TO THE LETTER

These are the entries the library does not cover. Each one below
gives the exact `provides` line, the runtime, the body's required
shape (from the real blocks) and the exact check. Write the body;
nothing else is yours to decide.

### Entry 1 — licence allows this use (licence id in the allowed list, personal or commercial flag) in eve + kron witnessed

**The clause it implements.** licence allows this use (licence id in the allowed list, personal or commercial flag) in eve + kron witnessed

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic c <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 2 — "fits on disk" in sutra + kron witnessed

**The clause it implements.** "fits on disk" in sutra + kron witnessed

**Runtime.** `kron` — the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic kron <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 3 — A model whose licence does not allow the use is never loaded

**The clause it implements.** A model whose licence does not allow the use is never loaded

**Runtime.** `eve` — the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic eve <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 4 — the owner decides

**The clause it implements.** the owner decides

**Runtime.** `-` — see the catalogue

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic - <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```
