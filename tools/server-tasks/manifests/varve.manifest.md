# varve — the complete manifest (the parameter document)

**Purpose.** Builds history timelines from archives, sources and dated events: the Hoard (`files.list`, `files.read`, `files.write`, `search.query`), versions (`backup.versions`), the companion's reading only with Lore's leave (`swarm.ask`).

**Matrix layer 243 · icon group L2 · wave spec `wave20/243-varve.md`.**

## The manifest: the parts the pattern library already makes correct

Every line below is FINAL — the provides, the body and the check are the
library's verified implementations. Emit them exactly.

## The app-specific entries — SPELLED OUT TO THE LETTER

These are the entries the library does not cover. Each one below
gives the exact `provides` line, the runtime, the body's required
shape (from the real blocks) and the exact check. Write the body;
nothing else is yours to decide.

### Entry 1 — - (critical) date shown for an event (each source's earliest and latest day number intersected

**The clause it implements.** - (critical) date shown for an event (each source's earliest and latest day number intersected

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic c <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 2 — circa ranges kept) in FORTRAN as Trebago + APL as KRON witnessed

**The clause it implements.** circa ranges kept) in FORTRAN as Trebago + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic sutra <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 3 — primary or secondary marked) in Ada as Eve

**The clause it implements.** primary or secondary marked) in Ada as Eve

**Runtime.** `trebago` — the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic trebago <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 4 — - event matrix (events x sources) in APL as KRON

**The clause it implements.** - event matrix (events x sources) in APL as KRON

**Runtime.** `eve` — the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic eve <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 5 — - archive catalogue and era tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**The clause it implements.** - archive catalogue and era tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `kron` — the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic kron <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 6 — the catalogue is MYRA's

**The clause it implements.** the catalogue is MYRA's

**Runtime.** `myra` — the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic myra <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 7 — Paraconsistent (BOTH test, in test_zxapp.c): source A dates an event to 1066 and source B to 1067 with no overlap, giving BOTH

**The clause it implements.** Paraconsistent (BOTH test, in test_zxapp.c): source A dates an event to 1066 and source B to 1067 with no overlap, giving BOTH

**Runtime.** `-` — see the catalogue

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic - <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 8 — never re-derive the tables

**The clause it implements.** never re-derive the tables

**Runtime.** `python` — the host tier (via the SDK): tooling and glue, exact integers.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic python <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```
