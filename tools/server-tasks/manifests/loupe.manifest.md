# loupe — the complete manifest (the parameter document)

**Purpose.** investigates incidents by tracing logs (`log.tail`), events (`journal.query`, `journal.verify`) and changes to files (`search.query`, `files.stat`) into a chain of evidence.

**Matrix layer 181 · icon group L2 · wave spec `wave15/181-loupe.md`.**

## The manifest: the parts the pattern library already makes correct

Every line below is FINAL — the provides, the body and the check are the
library's verified implementations. Emit them exactly.

## The app-specific entries — SPELLED OUT TO THE LETTER

These are the entries the library does not cover. Each one below
gives the exact `provides` line, the runtime, the body's required
shape (from the real blocks) and the exact check. Write the body;
nothing else is yours to decide.

### Entry 1 — evidence register (item number, custody hand-offs, never reused, refused on overflow) in COBOL as Sutra

**The clause it implements.** evidence register (item number, custody hand-offs, never reused, refused on overflow) in COBOL as Sutra

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic c <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

**Rules that the node enforces for this runtime:** the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

### Entry 2 — case tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**The clause it implements.** case tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic sutra <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**A real block from the built apps in this runtime — copy
this spelling exactly (`used.sutra`):**

```
record used-share
  total: 9(18)
  left: 9(18)
  used: 9(5)
procedure
  compute used = (total - left) * 10000 / total
  answer used
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

**Rules that the node enforces for this runtime:** the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.
