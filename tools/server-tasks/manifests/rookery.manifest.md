# rookery — the complete manifest (the parameter document)

**Purpose.** letters as signed envelopes to another companion (`web4.post`; held until `web4.consent` when pii is set), read from `web4.feed` and checked with `web4.verify`; drafts and folders in the Hoard (`files.write`, `files.list`). zxvd has no mail transport and no Web4 delivery yet: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

**Matrix layer 26 · icon group L1 · wave spec `wave5/026-rookery.md`.**

## The manifest: the parts the pattern library already makes correct

Every line below is FINAL — the provides, the body and the check are the
library's verified implementations. Emit them exactly.

```zxapp

end

```

## This app is COMPLETE from the library

No app-specific entries remain. Emit the manifest above exactly;
the node will load every entry and pass every check.
