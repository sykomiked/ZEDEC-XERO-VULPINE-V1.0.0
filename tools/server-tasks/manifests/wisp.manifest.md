# wisp — the complete manifest (the parameter document)

**Purpose.** Keeps light, offline maps, contacts and battery triage ready when power or network fails: battery, draw and source from `power.status` and `sys.info`; network state from `sys.net`; where the machine is and the saved places (`place.here`, `place.list`); emergency contacts and the medical ID from Watchfire's records (`files.read`); a low-power start with every optional switch off (`features.get`, `features.set`, owner-approved); ring a contact only on the person's request (`call.start`, signalling only). Offline map tiles and outside outage reports have no method: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## The manifest: the parts the pattern library already makes correct

Every line below is FINAL — the provides, the body and the check are the
library's verified implementations. Emit them exactly.

## The app-specific entries — SPELLED OUT TO THE LETTER

These are the entries the library does not cover. Each one below
gives the exact `provides` line, the runtime, the body's required
shape (from the real blocks) and the exact check. Write the body;
nothing else is yours to decide.

### Entry 1 — - priority grid (functions x priority rank, the order they are shed) in APL as KRON

**The clause it implements.** - priority grid (functions x priority rank, the order they are shed) in APL as KRON

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic c <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

**Rules that the node enforces for this runtime:** the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

### Entry 2 — - household medical tree (person, needs, medicines, stored as typed, never inferred) in MUMPS as MYRA

**The clause it implements.** - household medical tree (person, needs, medicines, stored as typed, never inferred) in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic sutra <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**A real block from the built apps in this runtime — copy
this spelling exactly (`used.sutra`):**

```
record used-share
  total: 9(18)
  left: 9(18)
  used: 9(5)
procedure
  compute used = (total - left) * 10000 / total
  answer used
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

**Rules that the node enforces for this runtime:** the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

### Entry 3 — never re-derive the tables

**The clause it implements.** never re-derive the tables

**Runtime.** `trebago` — the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic trebago <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**A real block from the built apps in this runtime — copy
this spelling exactly (`count.tb`):**

```
trebago kind_count
  in  kind(n), want
  out count
  count = sum(i, max(0, min(1, 1 + kind(i) - want)) * max(0, min(1, 1 + want - kind(i))))
end
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

**Rules that the node enforces for this runtime:** the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).
