# fulgurite — the complete manifest (the parameter document)

**Purpose.** ZXV builds ZXV. Fronts build_system/mk_golden_disc.sh, build_system/golden.contents, build_system/golden.models, build_system/test_golden_disc.sh, kernel/src/zxpkg (zxrelease) and kernel/src/provenance. Runs build and test templates (`play.run`), reads sources and writes artefacts and the bill of materials (`files.read`, `files.write`), versions (`backup.versions`), room on disk (`sys.disk`), publishes the bill of materials by CID (`aipi.put`, `web4.cid`), checks for updates (`update.check`). A build-run method and image signing have no method: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

**Matrix layer 245 · icon group L2 · wave spec `wave20/245-fulgurite.md`.**

## The manifest: the parts the pattern library already makes correct

Every line below is FINAL — the provides, the body and the check are the
library's verified implementations. Emit them exactly.

## The app-specific entries — SPELLED OUT TO THE LETTER

These are the entries the library does not cover. Each one below
gives the exact `provides` line, the runtime, the body's required
shape (from the real blocks) and the exact check. Write the body;
nothing else is yours to decide.

### Entry 1 — - (critical) "may sign" = reproducible AND every test TRUE (joined with `lpres_conjoin` in C) AND the mutation gate passed AND the owner approved, in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed

**The clause it implements.** - (critical) "may sign" = reproducible AND every test TRUE (joined with `lpres_conjoin` in C) AND the mutation gate passed AND the owner approved, in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic c <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 2 — - (critical) "refuse an unpinned download" (every dependency names a sha256 content id) in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed

**The clause it implements.** - (critical) "refuse an unpinned download" (every dependency names a sha256 content id) in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic sutra <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 3 — - bill-of-materials tree (component, version, licence, CID) in MUMPS as MYRA

**The clause it implements.** - bill-of-materials tree (component, version, licence, CID) in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `trebago` — the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic trebago <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 4 — Paraconsistent (BOTH test, in test_zxapp.c): two builds of the same source whose images differ in one byte give BOTH

**The clause it implements.** Paraconsistent (BOTH test, in test_zxapp.c): two builds of the same source whose images differ in one byte give BOTH

**Runtime.** `eve` — the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic eve <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 5 — never re-derive the tables

**The clause it implements.** never re-derive the tables

**Runtime.** `kron` — the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic kron <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```
