# syzygy — the complete manifest (the parameter document)

**Purpose.** two-party agreements witnessed in two languages: drafting, signing, obligations and disputes held fairly (`files.read`, `files.write`, `journal.query`, `web4.verify`, `pspace.post`).

**Matrix layer 303 · icon group L3 · wave spec `wave25/303-syzygy.md`.**

## The manifest: the parts the pattern library already makes correct

Every line below is FINAL — the provides, the body and the check are the
library's verified implementations. Emit them exactly.

## The app-specific entries — SPELLED OUT TO THE LETTER

These are the entries the library does not cover. Each one below
gives the exact `provides` line, the runtime, the body's required
shape (from the real blocks) and the exact check. Write the body;
nothing else is yours to decide.

### Entry 1 — `deadline_ok` (an obligation met on or before its deadline day) in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed

**The clause it implements.** `deadline_ok` (an obligation met on or before its deadline day) in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic c <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 2 — `contract_payments` (in minor units) in COBOL as Sutra + FORTRAN as Trebago witnessed

**The clause it implements.** `contract_payments` (in minor units) in COBOL as Sutra + FORTRAN as Trebago witnessed

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic sutra <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 3 — `clauses` matrix in APL as KRON

**The clause it implements.** `clauses` matrix in APL as KRON

**Runtime.** `trebago` — the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic trebago <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```

### Entry 4 — `parties` hierarchy in MUMPS as MYRA

**The clause it implements.** `parties` hierarchy in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `eve` — the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.

**The provides line (copy exactly, choose the entry name):**

```
provides <entry_name> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
```

**The body (this shape, this runtime):**

```
logic eve <entry_name> <<
<the source>
.
```

**The check (one line; the inputs are integers, the answers the
rows):**

```
check <entry_name> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...
```
