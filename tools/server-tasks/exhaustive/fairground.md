# fairground — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `fairground` |
| matrix layer | 79 |
| icon group | L1 |
| wave spec | `wave1/079-fairground.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

what the owner shares, wants and sells, settled sales and fees (`net.offers`, `net.command` share/want/sell, `swarm.state` market, `mesh.books`, `peer.status`). Networking is off by default.

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs peers`
- `needs net`
- `needs ledger.read`
- `needs notify`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- `use coffer 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use toolchest 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use vintner 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use trellis 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use commons 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | business | business records | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | exact numerics | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | limits | primary | runs |
| Eiffel | `-` | contracts | contracts | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Solidity | `-` | contracts | contracts | witness | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| SAS | `-` | report | reports | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

```

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `product` (num) — kron

**Args.** `a b`

**Semantics.** a * b exactly in minor units. Integer only.

**The exact check.** `check product a=1,12,0,999 b=1250,999,7,1000 = 1250,11988,0,999000`

### `limit_excess` (num) — trebago

**Args.** `value limit`

**Semantics.** The excess over a ceiling. 0 when value <= limit, else value - limit. Integer only; the limit is inclusive; no negative excess ever.

**The exact check.** `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000`

### `composite_key` (num) — kron

**Args.** `high low`

**Semantics.** The record's composite index: high*1000 + low. Explicit parens: K evaluates right to left.

**The exact check.** `check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — Every sell or want waits for the owner's approval

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
