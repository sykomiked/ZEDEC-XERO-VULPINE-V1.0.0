# meadow — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `meadow` |
| matrix layer | 86 |
| icon group | L1 |
| wave spec | `wave2/086-meadow.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

find, join and use public spaces (`pspace.find`, `pspace.join`, `pspace.leave`, `pspace.list`, `pspace.members`, `pspace.events`, `pspace.post`, `spaces.list` for park rights). Feature `pspace` is off by default.

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs peers`
- `needs net`
- `needs notify`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- `use seedbank 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use gatehouse 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use trellis 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use commons 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | records | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | exact numerics | primary | runs |
| Logo | `logo` | geometry | geometry | primary | runs |
| C# | `dotnet` | objects | domain objects | primary | planned: SDK host only, no in-app runtime yet |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

```zxapp
zxapp 1
id meadow
matrix 86
name Meadow
needs peers
needs net
needs notify

provides composite_key num high low
provides count_ok truth count cap
logic kron composite_key <<
0|((_high*1000)+_low)
.
logic eve count_ok <<
eve meadow
counts = 1 .. 100

count_ok {
  count: counts 1 .. 100
  cap: counts 100 .. 100
}
.
check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999
check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 cap=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false
```

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `composite_key` (num) — kron

**Args.** `high low`

**Semantics.** The record's composite index: high*1000 + low. Explicit parens: K evaluates right to left.

**The exact check.** `check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999`

### `count_ok` (truth) — eve

**Args.** `count cap`

**Semantics.** The registry law. true when 0 < count <= cap. A truth entry: the four values apply.

**The exact check.** `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 cap=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — Posts cannot be deleted (`pspace.post`): the app says so before sending

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
