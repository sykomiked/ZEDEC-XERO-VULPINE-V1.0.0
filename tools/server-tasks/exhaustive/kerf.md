# kerf — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `kerf` |
| matrix layer | 290 |
| icon group | L3 |
| wave spec | `wave24/290-kerf.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

runs a small workshop or factory: job orders, materials, machine time, quality checks and shipping, from the Hoard (`files.read`, `files.write`), the books (`ledger.entries`, `ledger.post`) and printed papers (`print.submit`). zxvd has no method for machine state readings: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs fs.read`
- `needs fs.write`
- `needs ledger.read`
- `needs ledger.post`
- `needs print`
- `needs notify`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- `use swage 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use ratchet 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use caliper 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use silt 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use tallystick 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | job costing | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | tolerance calculations | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | machine safety limits | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | production schedule grid | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | bill-of-materials tree | primary | runs |
| Bourne shell | `-` | jobs | jobs | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

```zxapp
zxapp 1

logic trebago exact_total <<
trebago exact_total
  in  n, a, b, c, d
  out total
  total = sum(i = 1:n, (i=1)*a + (i=2)*b + (i=3)*c + (i=4)*d)
end

check exact_total n=2,4,1,0 a=10,1,7,5 b=20,2,7,5 c=0,3,7,5 d=0,4,7,5 = 30,10,7,0
check product a=1,12,0,999 b=1250,999,7,1000 = 1250,11988,0,999000
```

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `exact_total` (num) — trebago

**Args.** `n a b c d`

**Semantics.** The exact sum of the first n of the four sizes. Integer only, no rounding, no overflow silently: the caller checks the bound.

**The exact check.** `check exact_total n=2,4,1,0 a=10,1,7,5 b=20,2,7,5 c=0,3,7,5 d=0,4,7,5 = 30,10,7,0`

### `product` (num) — kron

**Args.** `a b`

**Semantics.** a * b exactly in minor units. Integer only.

**The exact check.** `check product a=1,12,0,999 b=1250,999,7,1000 = 1250,11988,0,999000`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — `machine_ok` (a job starts on a machine only with its guards closed, its service not overdue and an operator signed in) in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.2 — `schedule` grid (machine by hour) in APL as KRON

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic sutra <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

**A real block in this runtime — copy this spelling (`used.sutra`):**

```
record used-share
  total: 9(18)
  left: 9(18)
  used: 9(5)
procedure
  compute used = (total - left) * 10000 / total
  answer used
```

### 7.3 — `bom` tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `trebago` — the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic trebago <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

**A real block in this runtime — copy this spelling (`count.tb`):**

```
trebago kind_count
  in  kind(n), want
  out count
  count = sum(i, max(0, min(1, 1 + kind(i) - want)) * max(0, min(1, 1 + want - kind(i))))
end
```

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
