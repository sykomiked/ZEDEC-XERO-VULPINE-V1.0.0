# escapement — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `escapement` |
| matrix layer | 172 |
| icon group | L2 |
| wave spec | `wave14/172-escapement.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

keeps exact time across devices (`sys.info`, `devmesh.devices`, `net.peers`) and runs shifts, timesheets and timed jobs from it. zxvd has no method for a peer clock-offset query: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs sys.read`
- `needs peers`
- `needs notify`
- `needs fs.read`
- `needs fs.write`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- `use treadle 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use solstice 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use tallystick 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use sundial 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | timesheets | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | drift correction | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | deadline limits | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | schedule matrix | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | shift tree | primary | runs |
| Go | `go` | concurrency | concurrency | primary | planned: SDK host only, no in-app runtime yet |
| Bourne shell | `-` | jobs | jobs | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Crystal | `-` | machine | low-level system | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

```zxapp
zxapp 1
id escapement
matrix 172
name Escapement
needs sys.read
needs peers
needs notify
needs fs.read
needs fs.write

provides exact_total num n a b c d
logic trebago exact_total <<
trebago exact_total
  in  n, a, b, c, d
  out total
  total = sum(i = 1:n, (i=1)*a + (i=2)*b + (i=3)*c + (i=4)*d)
end
.
check exact_total n=2,4,1,0 a=10,1,7,5 b=20,2,7,5 c=0,3,7,5 d=0,4,7,5 = 30,10,7,0
```

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `exact_total` (num) — trebago

**Args.** `n a b c d`

**Semantics.** The exact sum of the first n of the four sizes. Integer only, no rounding, no overflow silently: the caller checks the bound.

**The exact check.** `check exact_total n=2,4,1,0 a=10,1,7,5 b=20,2,7,5 c=0,3,7,5 d=0,4,7,5 = 30,10,7,0`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — clock offset (median of the peers' offsets in ms) in FORTRAN as Trebago + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.2 — "job may run" (inside its window, deadline not passed) in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic sutra <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.3 — schedule matrix (person by shift, nobody booked twice at once) in APL as KRON

**Runtime.** `trebago` — the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic trebago <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.4 — shift tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `eve` — the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic eve <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
