# poultice — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `poultice` |
| matrix layer | 148 |
| icon group | L2 |
| wave spec | `wave12/148-poultice.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

a care plan of symptoms, medicines and vitals kept in the Hoard (`files.read`, `files.write`), reminding carers through notices (`notes.list`, `notes.mark_read`) and keeping doses within the limits the plan declares. zxvd has no method for a notice-post method (as Sundial reports), vitals device readings: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs fs.read`
- `needs fs.write`
- `needs notify`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- `use solstice 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use bowline 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use wellspring 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use watchfire 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | care costs | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | vital trends | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | dosage limits | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | symptom grid | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | patient tree | primary | runs |
| Simula I | `-` | simulation | simulation | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Modula-2 | `-` | structure | structure | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

```

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `limit_excess` (num) — trebago

**Args.** `value limit`

**Semantics.** The excess over a ceiling. 0 when value <= limit, else value - limit. Integer only; the limit is inclusive; no negative excess ever.

**The exact check.** `['check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000', 'check limit_excess value=1000,999 limit=1000,1000 = 0,0', 'check limit_excess value=1,1000000 limit=0,999999 = 1,1']`

### `count_ok` (truth) — eve

**Args.** `count cap`

**Semantics.** The registry law. true when 0 < count <= cap. A truth entry: the four values apply.

**The exact check.** `['check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 cap=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false', 'check count_ok count=2 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=99 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=101 cap=100 = false', 'check count_ok count=100 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=0 cap=100 = false', 'check count_ok count=1 cap=100 = true']`

### `product` (num) — kron

**Args.** `a b`

**Semantics.** a * b exactly in minor units. Integer only.

**The exact check.** `check product a=1,12,0,999 b=1250,999,7,1000 = 1250,11988,0,999000`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — vital trends (7-day min, max, mean floor per vital) in FORTRAN as Trebago

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.2 — patient tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic sutra <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

**A real block in this runtime — copy this spelling (`used.sutra`):**

```
record used-share
  total: 9(18)
  left: 9(18)
  used: 9(5)
procedure
  compute used = (total - left) * 10000 / total
  answer used
```

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
