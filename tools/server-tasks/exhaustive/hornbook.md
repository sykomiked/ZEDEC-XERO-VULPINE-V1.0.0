# hornbook — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `hornbook` |
| matrix layer | 169 |
| icon group | L2 |
| wave spec | `wave14/169-hornbook.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

builds lessons with diagrams, slides and flashcards in the Hoard (`files.read`, `files.write`), then tracks each learner's progress.

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs fs.read`
- `needs fs.write`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- `use footlight 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use sapling 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use nutshell 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use gnomon 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use typewright 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | enrolment records | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | score statistics | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | age-appropriate limits | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | mastery grid | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | learner tree | primary | runs |
| BASIC | `basic` | stepwise | step-by-step teaching | primary | runs |
| Mojo | `-` | ai | AI | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Bash | `-` | jobs | jobs | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

```

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `count_ok` (truth) — eve

**Args.** `count cap`

**Semantics.** The registry law. true when 0 < count <= cap. A truth entry: the four values apply.

**The exact check.** `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 cap=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false`

### `grade_band` (num) — kron

**Args.** `value b1 b2 b3 b4`

**Semantics.** The band index 0..4 of the value across the four ascending bounds. The comparisons sum (each true adds 1).

**The exact check.** `check grade_band value=0,5,15,25,100 b1=10,b2=20,b3=30,b4=40 = 0,0,1,2,4`

### `composite_key` (num) — kron

**Args.** `high low`

**Semantics.** The record's composite index: high*1000 + low. Explicit parens: K evaluates right to left.

**The exact check.** `check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — next lesson step from the learner's answer in BASIC (twin Hatchling) + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.2 — seats per class refused on overflow) in COBOL as Sutra

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic sutra <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.3 — score statistics (mean floor, min, max per question) exact in FORTRAN as Trebago

**Runtime.** `trebago` — the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic trebago <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.4 — mastery grid (learner by skill, mastered after k right in a row) in APL as KRON

**Runtime.** `eve` — the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic eve <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.5 — learner tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `kron` — the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic kron <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
