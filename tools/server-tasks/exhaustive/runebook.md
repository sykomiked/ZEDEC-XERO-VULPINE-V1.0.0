# runebook — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `runebook` |
| matrix layer | 114 |
| icon group | L1 |
| wave spec | `wave10/114-runebook.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

every character, emoji and symbol by script and block, with favourites saved in the Hoard (`files.read`, `files.write`); language names from `xlate.languages`. zxvd has no character-data method: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs fs.read`
- `needs fs.write`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- none beyond the core (layer 0)

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | exact numerics | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | arrays | primary | runs |
| Scheme | `scheme` | symbolic | symbolic reasoning | primary | runs |
| CPL | `-` | formula | formulas | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Icon | `-` | text | text | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

```zxapp
zxapp 1
id runebook
matrix 114
name Runebook
needs fs.read
needs fs.write

provides count_ok truth count cap
logic eve count_ok <<
eve runebook
counts = 1 .. 100

count_ok {
  count: counts 1 .. 100
  cap: counts 100 .. 100
}
.
check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 cap=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false
```

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `count_ok` (truth) — eve

**Args.** `count cap`

**Semantics.** The registry law. true when 0 < count <= cap. A truth entry: the four values apply.

**The exact check.** `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 cap=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — valid code point (0..0x10FFFF, not a surrogate, not a noncharacter) in kron + trebago witnessed

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.2 — UTF-8 length and bytes of a code point in trebago + kron witnessed

**Runtime.** `trebago` — the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic trebago <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
