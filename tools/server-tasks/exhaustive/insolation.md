# insolation — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `insolation` |
| matrix layer | 335 |
| icon group | L3 |
| wave spec | `wave28/335-insolation.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

runs a community wind and solar co-op: generation, storage, shares, mutual-aid grants and grid exports (`power.status`, `ledger.entries`, `ledger.post`, `ledger.hold`, `devmesh.devices`). zxvd has no method for turbine, inverter and meter readings: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs sys.read`
- `needs ledger.read`
- `needs ledger.post`
- `needs peers`
- `needs notify`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- `use isobar 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use levin 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use neap 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use understory 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use brazier 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | member grants | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | wind and sun yield model | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | grid export limits | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | turbine and panel grid | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | member share tree | primary | runs |
| Erlang | `-` | messaging | messaging | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `count_ok` (truth) — eve

**Args.** `count cap`

**Semantics.** The registry law. true when 0 < count <= cap. A truth entry: the four values apply.

**The exact check.** `['check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 cap=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false', 'check count_ok count=2 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=99 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=101 cap=100 = false', 'check count_ok count=100 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=0 cap=100 = false', 'check count_ok count=1 cap=100 = true']`

### `ratio_x1000` (num) — kron

**Args.** `num den`

**Semantics.** The ratio in thousandths, exact rational. The caller floors.

**The exact check.** `check ratio_x1000 num=1,1,1,3 den=3,8,1000,4 = 1000/3,125,1,750`

### `share_x100` (num) — kron

**Args.** `part whole`

**Semantics.** A part's share of a whole in hundredths of a percent, EXACT rational (the K's division is exact: 10000/3, not 3333). The caller floors.

**The exact check.** `['check share_x100 part=1,1,1,50 whole=3,4,100,100 = 10000/3,2500,100,5000', 'check share_x100 part=0 whole=1 = 0', 'check share_x100 part=1 whole=1 = 10000', 'check share_x100 part=1 whole=10000 = 1', 'check share_x100 part=3 whole=4 = 7500', 'check share_x100 part=2 whole=3 = 20000/3', 'check share_x100 part=1 whole=2 = 5000']`

### `largest_remainder` (num) — kron

**Args.** `pool w1 w2 w3 w4`

**Semantics.** The first recipient's exact share of the pool by weight; the largest-remainder apportionment's integer part is the caller's law.

**The exact check.** `check largest_remainder pool=100,10,7,100 w1=1,1,1,1 w2=1,1,1,1 w3=1,1,1,1 w4=1,0,0,0 = 25,10/3,7/3,50`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — `assets` grid (turbine and panel) in APL as KRON

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
