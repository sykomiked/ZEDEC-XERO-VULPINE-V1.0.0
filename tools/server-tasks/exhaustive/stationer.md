# stationer — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `stationer` |
| matrix layer | 202 |
| icon group | L2 |
| wave spec | `wave16/202-stationer.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

designs forms, letters and printed templates in the Hoard (`files.read`, `files.write`), prints (`print.status`, `print.submit`) and scans them (`scan.start`), and folds them into fill-and-sign packets.

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs fs.read`
- `needs fs.write`
- `needs print`
- `needs scan`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- `use folio 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use sealwax 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use burin 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use platen 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | form registry | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | layout math | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | field rules | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | field grid | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | form tree | primary | runs |
| PostScript | `-` | layout | page layout | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| APT | `-` | toolpath | tool paths | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Lua | `-` | scripting | scripting | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

```zxapp
zxapp 1
id stationer
matrix 202
name Stationer
needs fs.read
needs fs.write
needs print
needs scan

provides count_ok truth count cap
logic eve count_ok <<
eve stationer
counts = 1 .. 100

count_ok {
  count: counts 1 .. 100
  cap: counts 100 .. 100
}
.
check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 cap=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false
check count_ok count=2 cap=100 = true
check count_ok count=99 cap=100 = true
check count_ok count=101 cap=100 = false
check count_ok count=100 cap=100 = true
check count_ok count=0 cap=100 = false
check count_ok count=1 cap=100 = true
```

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `count_ok` (truth) — eve

**Args.** `count cap`

**Semantics.** The registry law. true when 0 < count <= cap. A truth entry: the four values apply.

**The exact check.** `['check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 cap=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false', 'check count_ok count=2 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=99 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=101 cap=100 = false', 'check count_ok count=100 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=0 cap=100 = false', 'check count_ok count=1 cap=100 = true']`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — field boxes fit the page (twips) in FORTRAN as Trebago + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.2 — "field valid" (length, range and required as declared) in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic sutra <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

**A real block in this runtime — copy this spelling (`used.sutra`):**

```
record used-share
  total: 9(18)
  left: 9(18)
  used: 9(5)
procedure
  compute used = (total - left) * 10000 / total
  answer used
```

### 7.3 — field grid in APL as KRON

**Runtime.** `trebago` — the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic trebago <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

**A real block in this runtime — copy this spelling (`count.tb`):**

```
trebago kind_count
  in  kind(n), want
  out count
  count = sum(i, max(0, min(1, 1 + kind(i) - want)) * max(0, min(1, 1 + want - kind(i))))
end
```

### 7.4 — form tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `eve` — the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic eve <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

**A real block in this runtime — copy this spelling (`transfer.eve`):**

```
eve coffer
minor_amount = 1 .. 9007199254740991
minor_left = 0 .. 999999999999999999
minor_gap = 0 .. 0

transfer_rule {
  amount: minor_amount
  after: minor_left
  room: minor_left
  gap: minor_gap
}
```

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
