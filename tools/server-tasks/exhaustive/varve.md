# varve — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `varve` |
| matrix layer | 243 |
| icon group | L2 |
| wave spec | `wave20/243-varve.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

Builds history timelines from archives, sources and dated events: the Hoard (`files.list`, `files.read`, `files.write`, `search.query`), versions (`backup.versions`), the companion's reading only with Lore's leave (`swarm.ask`).

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs fs.read`
- `needs fs.write`
- `needs search`
- `needs ai.ask`
- `needs backup`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- `use lore 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use solstice 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use keepsake 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use fieldguide 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | archive catalogue | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | date estimation | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | source rules | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | event matrix | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | era tree | primary | runs |
| JCL | `-` | jobs | jobs | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Python | `python` | ai | AI | primary | planned: SDK host only, no in-app runtime yet |
| Icon | `-` | text | text | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

```

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `count_ok` (truth) — eve

**Args.** `count cap`

**Semantics.** The registry law. true when 0 < count <= cap. A truth entry: the four values apply.

**The exact check.** `['check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 cap=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false', 'check count_ok count=2 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=99 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=101 cap=100 = false', 'check count_ok count=100 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=0 cap=100 = false', 'check count_ok count=1 cap=100 = true']`

### `difference` (num) — kron

**Args.** `a b`

**Semantics.** a - b exactly, never negative in the app's domain.

**The exact check.** `check difference a=10,5,0,100 b=3,5,0,99 = 7,0,0,1`

### `running_state` (truth) — kron

**Args.** `state event`

**Semantics.** The transition's legality: the (state,event) pairs that are allowed. A truth entry: both/neither are reachable.

**The exact check.** `check running_state state=0,0,1,1 event=1,2,1,2 = true,false,true,false`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — - (critical) date shown for an event (each source's earliest and latest day number intersected

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.2 — circa ranges kept) in FORTRAN as Trebago + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic sutra <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

**A real block in this runtime — copy this spelling (`used.sutra`):**

```
record used-share
  total: 9(18)
  left: 9(18)
  used: 9(5)
procedure
  compute used = (total - left) * 10000 / total
  answer used
```

### 7.3 — primary or secondary marked) in Ada as Eve

**Runtime.** `trebago` — the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic trebago <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

**A real block in this runtime — copy this spelling (`count.tb`):**

```
trebago kind_count
  in  kind(n), want
  out count
  count = sum(i, max(0, min(1, 1 + kind(i) - want)) * max(0, min(1, 1 + want - kind(i))))
end
```

### 7.4 — - event matrix (events x sources) in APL as KRON

**Runtime.** `eve` — the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic eve <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

**A real block in this runtime — copy this spelling (`transfer.eve`):**

```
eve coffer
minor_amount = 1 .. 9007199254740991
minor_left = 0 .. 999999999999999999
minor_gap = 0 .. 0

transfer_rule {
  amount: minor_amount
  after: minor_left
  room: minor_left
  gap: minor_gap
}
```

### 7.5 — - archive catalogue and era tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `kron` — the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic kron <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

**A real block in this runtime — copy this spelling (`use.kron`):**

```
(asked>0)&(granted>0)&revoked<1
```

### 7.6 — the catalogue is MYRA's

**Runtime.** `myra` — the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic myra <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

**A real block in this runtime — copy this spelling (`dock.myra`):**

```
^ZXDOCK(place:i2) = app:i3! ^ pinned:i1! ^ added:i12!
```

### 7.7 — Paraconsistent (BOTH test, in test_zxapp.c): source A dates an event to 1066 and source B to 1067 with no overlap, giving BOTH

**Runtime.** `-` — 

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic - <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.8 — never re-derive the tables

**Runtime.** `python` — the host tier (via the SDK): tooling and glue, exact integers.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic python <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
