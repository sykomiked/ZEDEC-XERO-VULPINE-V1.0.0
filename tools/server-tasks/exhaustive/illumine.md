# illumine — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `illumine` |
| matrix layer | 313 |
| icon group | L3 |
| wave spec | `wave26/313-illumine.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

publishes books from manuscript to finished edition: editing, layout, illustration, rights and sales (`files.read`, `files.write`, `print.submit`, `aipi.put`, `web4.cid`).

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs fs.read`
- `needs fs.write`
- `needs print`
- `needs net`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- `use spindrift 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use bindery 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use meander 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use folio 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use typecase 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | royalties | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | print cost model | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | rights limits | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | layout grid | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | chapter and edition tree | primary | runs |
| TeX | `-` | typesetting | typesetting | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Lua | `-` | scripting | scripting | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| AWK | `-` | text | text | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `composite_key` (num) — kron

**Args.** `high low`

**Semantics.** The record's composite index: high*1000 + low. Explicit parens: K evaluates right to left.

**The exact check.** `check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999`

### `product` (num) — kron

**Args.** `a b`

**Semantics.** a * b exactly in minor units. Integer only.

**The exact check.** `check product a=1,12,0,999 b=1250,999,7,1000 = 1250,11988,0,999000`

### `share_x100` (num) — kron

**Args.** `part whole`

**Semantics.** A part's share of a whole in hundredths of a percent, EXACT rational (the K's division is exact: 10000/3, not 3333). The caller floors.

**The exact check.** `['check share_x100 part=1,1,1,50 whole=3,4,100,100 = 10000/3,2500,100,5000', 'check share_x100 part=0 whole=1 = 0', 'check share_x100 part=1 whole=1 = 10000', 'check share_x100 part=1 whole=10000 = 1', 'check share_x100 part=3 whole=4 = 7500', 'check share_x100 part=2 whole=3 = 20000/3', 'check share_x100 part=1 whole=2 = 5000']`

### `largest_remainder` (num) — kron

**Args.** `pool w1 w2 w3 w4`

**Semantics.** The first recipient's exact share of the pool by weight; the largest-remainder apportionment's integer part is the caller's law.

**The exact check.** `check largest_remainder pool=100,10,7,100 w1=1,1,1,1 w2=1,1,1,1 w3=1,1,1,1 w4=1,0,0,0 = 25,10/3,7/3,50`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — `layout` grid in APL as KRON

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.2 — `editions` tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic sutra <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

**A real block in this runtime — copy this spelling (`used.sutra`):**

```
record used-share
  total: 9(18)
  left: 9(18)
  used: 9(5)
procedure
  compute used = (total - left) * 10000 / total
  answer used
```

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
