# thicket — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `thicket` |
| matrix layer | 262 |
| icon group | L2 |
| wave spec | `wave21/262-thicket.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

Fronts community updates (kernel/src/peer_audit, kernel/src/evolve with evo_upd.c, evo_lineage.c and evo_trust.c, kernel/src/update). Signed update check (`update.check`), proposals and votes (`spaces.propose`, `spaces.vote`), the circle's discussion (`social.feed`, `social.post`), test runs (`play.run`), signatures (`web4.verify`), the trail (`journal.query`), versions (`backup.versions`). Listing forks and peer audits, submitting an audit and installing a reviewed update have no method: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs net`
- `needs peers`
- `needs sys.read`
- `needs journal`
- `needs backup`
- `needs notify`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- `use tideturn 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use graft 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use gauntlet 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use witness 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use hamlet 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | proposal ledger | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | test score arithmetic | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | refuses an update without an audit | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | review matrix | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | fork tree | primary | runs |
| SAS | `-` | report | reports | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| ML | `-` | proof | proofs of correctness | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| ALGOL 60 | `algol60` | proof | proofs of correctness | witness | runs |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

```zxapp
zxapp 1
id thicket
matrix 262

needs peers
needs sys.read
needs journal
needs backup
needs notify

provides count_ok truth count cap
provides running_state truth state event
logic eve count_ok <<
eve thicket
counts = 1 .. 100

count_ok {
  count: counts 1 .. 100
  cap: counts 100 .. 100
}
.
logic kron running_state <<
((_state=0)&(_event=1))|((_state=1)&(_event=1))
.
check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 cap=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false
check running_state state=0,0,1,1 event=1,2,1,2 = true,false,true,false
```

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `count_ok` (truth) — eve

**Args.** `count cap`

**Semantics.** The registry law. true when 0 < count <= cap. A truth entry: the four values apply.

**The exact check.** `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 cap=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false`

### `running_state` (truth) — kron

**Args.** `state event`

**Semantics.** The transition's legality: the (state,event) pairs that are allowed. A truth entry: both/neither are reachable.

**The exact check.** `check running_state state=0,0,1,1 event=1,2,1,2 = true,false,true,false`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — - (critical) "may accept" = an audit present AND the auditors agree AND tests TRUE AND both signatures valid, in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.2 — - (critical) test score x100 (weighted passes per suite) in FORTRAN as Trebago + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic sutra <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.3 — - review matrix (auditors x checks) in APL as KRON

**Runtime.** `trebago` — the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic trebago <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.4 — - fork tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `eve` — the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic eve <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.5 — Paraconsistent (BOTH test, in test_zxapp.c): auditor A passes an update and auditor B fails it, giving BOTH

**Runtime.** `kron` — the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic kron <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.6 — never re-derive the tables

**Runtime.** `myra` — the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic myra <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
