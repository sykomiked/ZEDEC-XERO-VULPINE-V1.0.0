# verderer — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `verderer` |
| matrix layer | 176 |
| icon group | L2 |
| wave spec | `wave14/176-verderer.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

logs wildlife sightings, trails and habitats with photos (`files.read`, `files.write`) and maps (`place.here`, `place.add`, `place.list`), searchable with `search.query`.

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs camera`
- `needs location`
- `needs fs.read`
- `needs fs.write`
- `needs search`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- `use pinhole 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use waymark 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use weatherglass 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use fieldguide 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | survey records | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | population model | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | protected-area limits | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | sighting grid | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | species tree | primary | runs |
| MATLAB | `-` | matrix | matrices and images | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

```zxapp
zxapp 1

provides limit_excess num value limit
provides share_x100 num part whole
logic trebago limit_excess <<

  excess = max(0, value - limit)
end

.
check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000
check share_x100 part=1,1,1,50 whole=3,4,100,100 = 10000/3,2500,100,5000
```

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `limit_excess` (num) — trebago

**Args.** `value limit`

**Semantics.** The excess over a ceiling. 0 when value <= limit, else value - limit. Integer only; the limit is inclusive; no negative excess ever.

**The exact check.** `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000`

### `share_x100` (num) — kron

**Args.** `part whole`

**Semantics.** A part's share of a whole in hundredths of a percent, EXACT rational (the K's division is exact: 10000/3, not 3333). The caller floors.

**The exact check.** `check share_x100 part=1,1,1,50 whole=3,4,100,100 = 10000/3,2500,100,5000`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — sighting grid (species by grid cell) in APL as KRON

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.2 — species tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic sutra <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
