# hark — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `hark` |
| matrix layer | 134 |
| icon group | L1 |
| wave spec | `wave11/134-hark.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

run commands by voice; free requests go to `swarm.ask` and come back as suggestions held for the person; language from `xlate.detect`. zxvd has no speech-to-text method: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs mic`
- `needs ai.ask`
- `needs notify`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- none beyond the core (layer 0)

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | safety | safety rules | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | records | primary | runs |
| Mojo | `-` | ai | AI | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Racket | `-` | parse | parsing | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Perl | `-` | text | text | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

```zxapp
zxapp 1
id hark
matrix 134
name Hark
needs mic
needs ai.ask
needs notify

provides limit_excess num value limit
logic trebago limit_excess <<
trebago limit_excess
  in  value, limit
  out excess
  excess = max(0, value - limit)
end
.
check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000
```

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `limit_excess` (num) — trebago

**Args.** `value limit`

**Semantics.** The excess over a ceiling. 0 when value <= limit, else value - limit. Integer only; the limit is inclusive; no negative excess ever.

**The exact check.** `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — "may run by voice" = known command AND confidence at least the threshold AND not a held kind (trash, empty Trash, send, pay, grant, approve) without a spoken confirm, in eve + kron witnessed

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.2 — command phrase table (phrase, command, kind) in myra

**Runtime.** `eve` — the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic eve <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.3 — Voice never approves money, grants, deletions or access by itself

**Runtime.** `myra` — the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic myra <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.4 — those need the person's second confirm

**Runtime.** `-` — 

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic - <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
