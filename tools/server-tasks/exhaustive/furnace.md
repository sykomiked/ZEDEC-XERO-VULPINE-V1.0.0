# furnace — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `furnace` |
| matrix layer | 199 |
| icon group | L2 |
| wave spec | `wave16/199-furnace.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

runs a home or village microgrid: solar output, storage and when to use power, from `power.status`, `power.top`, `power.budget` and `sys.info`. zxvd has no method for solar inverter, meter and battery bank readings: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs sys.read`
- `needs notify`
- `needs net`
- `needs peers`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- `use brazier 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use weatherglass 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use understory 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line
- `use homestead 1` — call `<id>.<entry>` after the use line

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | energy accounts | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | solar model | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | grid limits | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | load grid | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | site tree | primary | runs |
| IEC 61131-3 Structured Text | `-` | control | machine control | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `count_ok` (truth) — eve

**Args.** `count cap`

**Semantics.** The registry law. true when 0 < count <= cap. A truth entry: the four values apply.

**The exact check.** `['check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 cap=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false', 'check count_ok count=2 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=99 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=101 cap=100 = false', 'check count_ok count=100 cap=100 = true', 'check count_ok count=0 cap=100 = false', 'check count_ok count=1 cap=100 = true']`

### `limit_excess` (num) — trebago

**Args.** `value limit`

**Semantics.** The excess over a ceiling. 0 when value <= limit, else value - limit. Integer only; the limit is inclusive; no negative excess ever.

**The exact check.** `['check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000', 'check limit_excess value=1000,999 limit=1000,1000 = 0,0', 'check limit_excess value=1,1000000 limit=0,999999 = 1,1']`

### `modular_draw` (num) — kron

**Args.** `seed members step`

**Semantics.** The sortition's modular walk. Integer only, no hashing in the block. The residue operator is '|' in K ('%' is division).

**The exact check.** `check modular_draw seed=1,1,1,2 members=10,10,10,7 step=0,1,2,0 = 5,2,9,6`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — expected solar Wh (panel watts x sun minutes / 60) in FORTRAN as Trebago + APL as KRON witnessed

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.2 — load grid in APL as KRON

**Runtime.** `sutra` — the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic sutra <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

**A real block in this runtime — copy this spelling (`used.sutra`):**

```
record used-share
  total: 9(18)
  left: 9(18)
  used: 9(5)
procedure
  compute used = (total - left) * 10000 / total
  answer used
```

### 7.3 — site tree in MUMPS as MYRA

**Runtime.** `trebago` — the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic trebago <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

**A real block in this runtime — copy this spelling (`count.tb`):**

```
trebago kind_count
  in  kind(n), want
  out count
  count = sum(i, max(0, min(1, 1 + kind(i) - want)) * max(0, min(1, 1 + want - kind(i))))
end
```

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
