# riddle — the exhaustive specification

| field | value |
|---|---|
| app id | `riddle` |
| matrix layer | 104 |
| icon group | L1 |
| wave spec | `wave9/104-riddle.md` |
| status | pending |

## 1. Purpose

logic and number puzzles; saves in the Banker (`files.read`, `files.write`); hints from `swarm.ask`.

## 2. Capabilities (the exact registry names and scopes)

- `needs fs.read`
- `needs fs.write`
- `needs ai.ask`

These are the ONLY capability names the loader accepts. A name not in the kernel's table refuses the whole manifest.

## 3. Dependencies (the built apps this one calls)

- none beyond the core (layer 0)

## 4. The language bindings (which language owns which component)

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | records | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | arrays | primary | runs |
| Mojo | `-` | ai | AI | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Prolog | `-` | rules | rules | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| BASIC | `basic` | stepwise | step-by-step teaching | primary | runs |

## 5. The complete manifest — VERIFIED (the library's proven bodies)

Every line is final: these bodies and checks were proven against a running node (satchel: loaded, checks passed). Emit exactly.

```zxapp
zxapp 1
id riddle
matrix 104
name Riddle
needs fs.read
needs fs.write
needs ai.ask

provides product num a b
logic kron product <<
0|_a*_b
.
check product a=1,12,0,999 b=1250,999,7,1000 = 1250,11988,0,999000
```

## 6. The entry specifications (what each entry computes)

### `product` (num) — kron

**Args.** `a b`

**Semantics.** a * b exactly in minor units. Integer only.

**The exact check.** `check product a=1,12,0,999 b=1250,999,7,1000 = 1250,11988,0,999000`

## 7. The app-specific entries (spelled out to the letter)

The library does not cover these clauses. Each below gives the clause, the runtime, and the required shapes.

### 7.1 — daily puzzle pick from the date in kron

**Runtime.** `c` — the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic c <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

### 7.2 — puzzles and times in myra

**Runtime.** `myra` — the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.

**provides line:** `provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...`

**body:** `logic myra <entry> <<` then the source then `.`

**check:** `check <entry> <arg>=<int>,... = <answer>,...`

## 8. The dual interface (human and AI)

- **Human.** The app's icon (its matrix slot's ZXVG) launches it from the desk; its entries' views render on the framebuffer.
- **AI.** Every provided entry is callable through the app runtime (`zxapp_call`) and the `--ai-manifest` surface; the same state the human sees.

## 9. The test plan

- The node loads the manifest (`zxapp_load`): every logic entry compiles.
- Every check line runs and passes (`zxapp_check`): the exact answers.
- The browser engine (`zxv_app.wasm`) loads the same manifest and passes the same checks.
