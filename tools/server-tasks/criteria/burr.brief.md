# burr — the complete brief

## Purpose

sticky notes on the desktop, each a text file in a Notes folder of the Hoard (`files.list`, `files.read`, `files.write`, `files.mkdir`, `files.trash`); a removed note goes to the Trash and can be put back.

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `fs.read`
- `fs.write`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | exact numerics | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | arrays | primary | runs |
| SNOBOL | `-` | text | text | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Short Code | `-` | formula | formulas | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **trebago** (FORTRAN): the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).
- **kron** (APL): the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.
- **-** (SNOBOL): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- placement of a new note (cascade by a step, wrap to the top when off screen) in kron + trebago witnessed
- limits (at most 256 notes, text at most 49152 bytes, the read_max of `files.read`) in kron

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `limit_excess` | num | `value limit` | trebago | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
| `count_ok` | truth | `count max` | kron | `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 max=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false` |

## The manifest contract
