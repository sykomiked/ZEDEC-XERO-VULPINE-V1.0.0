# Criteria (instantiated) — colonnade

matrix 127 · wave spec `wave3/127-colonnade.md`

| the spec's clause | pattern | kind | args | languages | logic | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fuel left (fuel_max - spent, refused below zero) in sutra +  | `difference` | num | `a,b` | trebago, kron | a - b exactly (never negative in this app's domain) | `check difference a=10,5,0,100 b=3,5,0,99 = 7,0,0,1` |
| runs per pillar and time totals exact in trebago | `exact_total` | num | `n,a,b,c,d` | trebago | the exact sum of the first n of a,b,c,d (the accumulator law) | `check exact_total n=2,4,1,0 a=10,1,7,5 b=20,2,7,5 c=0,3,7,5 d=0,4,7,5 = 30,10,7,0` |
| run limits (output at most 49152 bytes, at most 60 s) in eve | `limit_excess` | num | `value,limit` | trebago, eve | 0 when value <= limit, else value - limit (the ceiling's excess) | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
| run limits (output at most 49152 bytes, at most 60 s) in eve | `count_ok` | truth | `count,max` | eve, kron | true when 0 < count <= max (the registry's law) | `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 max=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false` |
| language to pillar index (from LANGUAGE_FIT.tsv, runtime col | `composite_key` | num | `high,low` | myra, kron | the record's index: high * 1000 + low (the cellar's composite key) | `check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999` |

## Clauses the pattern library does not yet cover (author these)

- verdict across witnessed runs (all agree, or BOTH with each side kept) in eve + kron witnessed
- A draft from the swarm is checked like anything a person types
