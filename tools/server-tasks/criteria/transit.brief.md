## Purpose

moves parcels from sender to doorstep: pickups, routes, handoffs, proof of delivery and payment (`net.peers`, `freight.pack`, `ledger.entries`, `ledger.hold`, `ledger.release`, `files.read`, `files.write`).

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `peers`
- `net`
- `ledger.read`
- `ledger.post`
- `fs.read`
- `fs.write`
- `notify`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | delivery invoices | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | route optimisation | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | driver hour limits | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | route grid | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | consignment hierarchy | primary | runs |
| ML | `-` | proof | proofs of correctness | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| ALGOL 60 | `algol60` | proof | proofs of correctness | witness | runs |
| Prolog | `-` | search | search | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **sutra** (COBOL): the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.
- **trebago** (FORTRAN): the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).
- **eve** (Ada): the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.
- **kron** (APL): the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.
- **myra** (MUMPS): the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.
- **-** (ML): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier
- **algol60** (ALGOL 60): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- `hours_ok` (a driver's minutes today at most the declared limit) in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed
- `route` (stop order over the distance matrix) in FORTRAN as Trebago + APL as KRON witnessed
- `delivery_invoice` (charged weight x rate in minor units) in COBOL as Sutra + FORTRAN as Trebago witnessed
- `routes` grid in APL as KRON
- `consignments` hierarchy in MUMPS as MYRA

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `limit_excess` | num | `value limit` | trebago | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
| `count_ok` | truth | `count max` | kron | `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 max=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false` |
| `ratio_x1000` | num | `num den` | kron | `check ratio_x1000 num=1,1,1,3 den=3,8,1000,4 = 333,125,1,750` |
