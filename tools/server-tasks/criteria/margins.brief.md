# margins — the complete brief

## Purpose

notes as files in the Hoard's Notes folder (`files.list`, `files.read`, `files.write`, `files.rename`, `files.trash`), found with `search.query`. Build on kernel/src/apps/notes_app.c.

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `fs.read`
- `fs.write`
- `search`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | records | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | arrays | primary | runs |
| SNOBOL | `-` | text | text | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| TeX | `-` | typesetting | typesetting | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| PostScript | `-` | layout | page layout | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **myra** (MUMPS): the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.
- **kron** (APL): the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.
- **-** (SNOBOL): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- note size limits in eve
- tag index in myra
- pinned and recent order in kron
- Text work (words, lines) stays C: its best-fit languages have no runtime yet
- say so in the manifest

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `limit_excess` | num | `value limit` | trebago | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
| `composite_key` | num | `high low` | myra | `check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999` |
