## Purpose

messages over radio bands (`ehop.bands`, `ehop.seal`, `ehop.open`), line frames (`harmonic.encode`, `harmonic.decode`), long messages as freight (`freight.pack`, `freight.unpack`). Radio hardware has no method: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `net`
- `notify`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | limits | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | records | primary | runs |
| Gleam | `-` | messaging | messaging | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Perl | `-` | text | text | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| LabVIEW | `-` | signal | signals | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **eve** (Ada): the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.
- **myra** (MUMPS): the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.
- **-** (Gleam): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- frame tag split (tag = 100 x sync + 10 x shell + trunk) in forth + kron witnessed
- "fits the band" (bytes within the band's largest frame) in eve + kron witnessed
- resolver threshold limits in eve
- message log in myra
- Messages only, never settlement: no `ledger.*`, no amounts. The owner keeps to the bands their licence allows
- Aerie never transmits in tests

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `share_x100` | num | `part whole` | kron | `check share_x100 part=1,1,1,50 whole=3,4,100,100 = 3333,2500,100,5000` |
| `grade_band` | num | `value b1 b2 b3 b4` | kron | `check grade_band value=0,5,15,25,100 b1=10,b2=20,b3=30,b4=40 = 0,0,1,2,4` |
| `limit_excess` | num | `value limit` | trebago | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
| `product` | num | `a b` | sutra | `check product a=1,12,0,999 b=1250,999,7,1000 = 1250,11988,0,999000` |
