# reckoner — the complete brief

## Purpose

period statements and tax estimates from the books (`ledger.entries`, `ledger.check`, `iso20022.render` camt.053, `jurisdiction.get`), saved through the Banker (`files.write`).

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `ledger.read`
- `fs.write`
- `print`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | money and ledgers | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | exact numerics | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | limits | primary | runs |
| RPG | `-` | report | reports | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Eiffel | `-` | contracts | contracts | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Solidity | `-` | contracts | contracts | witness | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **sutra** (COBOL): the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.
- **trebago** (FORTRAN): the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).
- **eve** (Ada): the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.
- **-** (RPG): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- period totals per account in trebago + sutra witnessed
- tax estimate over integer bands in sutra + trebago witnessed
- "report allowed" (closed period, `ledger.check` ok) in eve. Books verification is shown as `ledger.check` returns it
- Tax figures are advisory, not tax advice
- a person files

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exact_total` | num | `n a b c d` | trebago | `check exact_total n=2,4,1,0 a=10,1,7,5 b=20,2,7,5 c=0,3,7,5 d=0,4,7,5 = 30,10,7,0` |
| `count_ok` | truth | `count max` | kron | `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 max=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false` |
| `grade_band` | num | `value b1 b2 b3 b4` | kron | `check grade_band value=0,5,15,25,100 b1=10,b2=20,b3=30,b4=40 = 0,0,1,2,4` |
