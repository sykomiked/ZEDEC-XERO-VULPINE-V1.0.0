# wordhoard — the complete brief

| matrix layer | 46 |
| icon group | L1 |
| wave spec | `wave6/046-wordhoard.md` |

## Purpose

word lists kept in the Hoard (`files.read`, `search.query`), the language of a word (`xlate.detect`, `xlate.languages`); a definition from the model (`swarm.ask`) is held until the owner accepts it.

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `fs.read`
- `search`
- `ai.ask`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | records | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | arrays | primary | runs |
| AWK | `-` | text | text | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| TeX | `-` | typesetting | typesetting | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| PostScript | `-` | layout | page layout | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **myra** (MUMPS): the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.
- **kron** (APL): the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.
- **-** (AWK): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- headword index and prefix lookup in myra
- "did you mean" edit distance over code points in C++ wasm
- synonym order by shared senses in kron

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `composite_key` | num | `high low` | myra | `check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999` |
| `share_x100` | num | `part whole` | kron | `check share_x100 part=1,1,1,50 whole=3,4,100,100 = 3333,2500,100,5000` |
