# Criteria (instantiated) — crier

matrix 156 · wave spec `wave12/156-crier.md`

| the spec's clause | pattern | kind | args | languages | logic | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| "may broadcast to this channel" = the sender may post there  | `limit_excess` | num | `value,limit` | trebago, eve | 0 when value <= limit, else value - limit (the ceiling's excess) | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
| "may broadcast to this channel" = the sender may post there  | `ratio_x1000` | num | `num,den` | kron, trebago | the ratio in thousandths, floor: num * 1000 / den | `check ratio_x1000 num=1,1,1,3 den=3,8,1000,4 = 333,125,1,750` |
| rate limits (at most n a channel an hour) in Ada as Eve | `limit_excess` | num | `value,limit` | trebago, eve | 0 when value <= limit, else value - limit (the ceiling's excess) | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
| rate limits (at most n a channel an hour) in Ada as Eve | `count_ok` | truth | `count,max` | eve, kron | true when 0 < count <= max (the registry's law) | `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 max=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false` |
| reach (members known per channel, summed) exact in FORTRAN a | `exact_total` | num | `n,a,b,c,d` | trebago | the exact sum of the first n of a,b,c,d (the accumulator law) | `check exact_total n=2,4,1,0 a=10,1,7,5 b=20,2,7,5 c=0,3,7,5 d=0,4,7,5 = 30,10,7,0` |
