## Purpose

standing streams and tithes the owner sets up, paid by `ledger.post` per period; read back with `ledger.entries`; `estate.stream`'s cumulative rule (floor(total x share), held-back units carried) is the pattern. No stream method exists: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `ledger.read`
- `ledger.post`
- `notify`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | money and ledgers | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | exact numerics | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | limits | primary | runs |
| Scala | `-` | dataflow | dataflow | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Eiffel | `-` | contracts | contracts | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Solidity | `-` | contracts | contracts | witness | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **sutra** (COBOL): the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.
- **trebago** (FORTRAN): the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).
- **eve** (Ada): the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.
- **-** (Scala): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- amount due at tick t = floor(total x t / T) minus already paid, in sutra + trebago witnessed
- a tithe = floor(income x num / den) with the carried remainder in sutra + trebago witnessed
- "stream allowed" (under the owner's per-day cap and balance) in eve + sutra witnessed
- A stream starts, changes or stops only on the owner's approval
- no unit is lost to rounding (remainders carry)

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `difference` | num | `a b` | trebago | `check difference a=10,5,0,100 b=3,5,0,99 = 7,0,0,1` |
| `product` | num | `a b` | sutra | `check product a=1,12,0,999 b=1250,999,7,1000 = 1250,11988,0,999000` |
| `limit_excess` | num | `value limit` | trebago | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
