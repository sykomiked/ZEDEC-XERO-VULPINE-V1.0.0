# granary — the complete brief

## Purpose

the model slot (`model.info`), room on disk (`sys.disk`), energy (`power.status`). Downloading a model and reading its licence have no method: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `net`
- `sys.read`
- `fs.read`
- `fs.write`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | arrays | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | limits | primary | runs |
| Mojo | `-` | ai | AI | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Occam | `-` | concurrency | concurrency | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Simula I | `-` | simulation | simulation | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **kron** (APL): the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.
- **eve** (Ada): the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.
- **-** (Mojo): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- licence allows this use (licence id in the allowed list, personal or commercial flag) in eve + kron witnessed
- "fits on disk" in sutra + kron witnessed
- memory need (parameters x bits / 8) exact in trebago
- model record in myra
- A model whose licence does not allow the use is never loaded
- the owner decides

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `flags_none` | truth | `bits forbidden` | kron | `check flags_none bits=0,1,2,3 forbidden=1,1,1,1 = true,false,true,false` |
| `composite_key` | num | `high low` | myra | `check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999` |
