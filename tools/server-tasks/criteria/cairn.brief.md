## Purpose

Runs community governance: proposals and votes (`spaces.propose`, `spaces.vote`, `spaces.get`, `spaces.set_members`), the circle (`social.post`, `social.feed`), signed decisions checked (`web4.verify`), the trail (`journal.query`), rulings saved (`files.write`).

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `peers`
- `net`
- `journal`
- `fs.write`
- `notify`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | member register | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | vote tallies | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | quorum rules | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | ballot matrix | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | council tree | primary | runs |
| Prolog | `-` | rules | rules | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Haskell | `-` | proof | proofs of correctness | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| ML | `-` | proof | proofs of correctness | witness | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **sutra** (COBOL): the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.
- **trebago** (FORTRAN): the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).
- **eve** (Ada): the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.
- **kron** (APL): the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.
- **myra** (MUMPS): the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.
- **-** (Prolog): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- - (critical) vote tallies (yes, no, abstain per proposal) in FORTRAN as Trebago + APL as KRON witnessed
- - (critical) "decision carried" (quorum met AND the majority threshold) in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed
- - ballot matrix (members x proposals) in APL as KRON
- - member register and council tree in MUMPS as MYRA
- - Sutra is left out: no money or counted business records
- the register is MYRA's
- Paraconsistent (BOTH test, in test_zxapp.c): two rulings on one matter contradict, giving BOTH
- the test asserts state 3 and that both stand until the arbiter or a majority resolves them. Join the sources with `lpres_conjoin` / `lpres_disjoin` in C
- never re-derive the tables

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `difference` | num | `a b` | trebago | `check difference a=10,5,0,100 b=3,5,0,99 = 7,0,0,1` |
| `count_ok` | truth | `count max` | kron | `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 max=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false` |
| `running_state` | truth | `state event` | kron | `check running_state state=0,0,1,1 event=1,2,1,2 = true,false,true,false` |
