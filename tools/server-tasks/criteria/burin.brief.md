# burin — the complete brief

| | |
|---|---|
| matrix layer | 54 |
| icon group | L1 |
| wave spec | `wave7/054-burin.md` |

## Purpose

drawings as files (`files.read`, `files.write`), printed (`print.submit`).

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `fs.read`
- `fs.write`
- `print`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | arrays | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | exact numerics | primary | runs |
| APT | `-` | toolpath | tool paths | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Logo | `logo` | geometry | geometry | primary | runs |
| LabVIEW | `-` | signal | signals | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **kron** (APL): the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.
- **trebago** (FORTRAN): the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).
- **-** (APT): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier
- **logo** (Logo): the run tier (Lingua): turtle/geometry steps for the visual apps.

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- curve flattening (de Casteljau in fixed point) in C++ wasm + kron witnessed
- hatch lines across a shape (count and spacing) in kron + trebago
- path limits in eve
- path record in myra

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `count_ok` | truth | `count max` | kron | `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 max=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false` |
| `limit_excess` | num | `value limit` | trebago | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
| `composite_key` | num | `high low` | myra | `check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999` |
