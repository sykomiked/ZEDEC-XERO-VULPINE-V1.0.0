# toolchest — the complete brief

## Purpose

the SDK kits (sdk/kits, the language SDKs) with what each needs; daemon version from `zxvd.version`, its methods from `rpc.discover`, samples from `play.catalogue`, update check with `update.check`. zxvd has no kit-install method: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `sys.read`
- `net`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | money and ledgers | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | exact numerics | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | limits | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | arrays | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | records | primary | runs |
| Raku | `-` | parse | parsing | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Haskell | `-` | types | typed data | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Bash | `-` | jobs | jobs | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **sutra** (COBOL): the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.
- **trebago** (FORTRAN): the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).
- **eve** (Ada): the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.
- **kron** (APL): the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.
- **myra** (MUMPS): the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.
- **-** (Raku): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- kit fits this zxvd (major.minor.patch compare) in sutra + kron witnessed
- "may install" = both signatures valid AND fits AND size at most free space, in eve + kron witnessed
- download and installed sizes exact in trebago
- kit record (name, version, language, size) in myra
- Never install anything in tests

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `count_ok` | truth | `count max` | kron | `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 max=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false` |
| `composite_key` | num | `high low` | myra | `check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999` |

## The manifest contract

```

provides <entry> num|truth <arg> <arg> ...
logic <runtime> <entry> <<
