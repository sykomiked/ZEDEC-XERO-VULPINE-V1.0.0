# ramble — the complete brief

## Purpose

the owner's envelope feed (`web4.open`, `web4.feed`, `web4.envelope`, `web4.verify`), content by CID (`aipi.get`, `web4.cid`), agent cards (`web4.card_verify`) and Chiglet intents held for consent (`web4.consent`). Pages over HTTP have no method: use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `net`
- `ledger.read`
- `notify`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | limits | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | records | primary | runs |
| Dart | `dart` | view | view and model | primary | planned: SDK host only, no in-app runtime yet |
| Gleam | `-` | messaging | messaging | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Occam | `-` | concurrency | concurrency | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **eve** (Ada): the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.
- **myra** (MUMPS): the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.
- **dart** (Dart): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier
- **-** (Gleam): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- CID string check (prefix, length, base32 alphabet, as byte codes) in Rust wasm + kron witnessed
- "consent covers this" (scope matches, amount_minor within ceiling, not expired) in eve + sutra witnessed
- envelope index in myra
- Ramble never grants consent by itself: a grant with money is advisory and the owner's act

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `limit_excess` | num | `value limit` | trebago | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
| `product` | num | `a b` | sutra | `check product a=1,12,0,999 b=1250,999,7,1000 = 1250,11988,0,999000` |
| `composite_key` | num | `high low` | myra | `check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999` |
