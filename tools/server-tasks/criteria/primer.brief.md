## Purpose

learn Sutra, Trebago, Eve, KRON and MYRA by doing (`play.catalogue`, `play.run` on scratch state, `play.draft` for hints).

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `ai.ask`
- `fs.read`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | money and ledgers | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | exact numerics | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | limits | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | arrays | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | records | primary | runs |
| Python | `python` | ai | AI | primary | planned: SDK host only, no in-app runtime yet |
| BASIC | `basic` | stepwise | step-by-step teaching | primary | runs |
| OCaml | `-` | parse | parsing | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **sutra** (COBOL): the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.
- **trebago** (FORTRAN): the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).
- **eve** (Ada): the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.
- **kron** (APL): the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.
- **myra** (MUMPS): the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.
- **python** (Python): the host tier (via the SDK): tooling and glue, exact integers.
- **basic** (BASIC): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier
- **-** (OCaml): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- "lesson passed" (`play.run` verdict TRUE and the expected output) in eve + kron witnessed
- each pillar's exercises in that pillar (sutra money, trebago sums, eve limits, kron arrays, myra records)
- first steps track in basic
- progress x100 in kron
- results in myra
- `play.draft` text is untrusted: shown as a hint, never run without the learner's action

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `limit_excess` | num | `value limit` | trebago | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
| `exact_total` | num | `n a b c d` | trebago | `check exact_total n=2,4,1,0 a=10,1,7,5 b=20,2,7,5 c=0,3,7,5 d=0,4,7,5 = 30,10,7,0` |
