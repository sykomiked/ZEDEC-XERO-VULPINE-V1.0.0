## Purpose

drafts, negotiates and signs multi-party agreements in the Hoard (`files.read`, `files.write`) with every revision on the journal (`journal.query`, `journal.verify`) and signatures checked with `web4.verify`.

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `fs.read`
- `fs.write`
- `journal`
- `peers`
- `notify`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | obligations ledger | primary | runs |
| FORTRAN | `trebago` | numeric | payment schedules | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | clause limits | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | party matrix | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | clause tree | primary | runs |
| ALGOL 60 | `algol60` | proof | proofs of correctness | primary | runs |
| Haskell | `-` | proof | proofs of correctness | witness | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Eiffel | `-` | contracts | contracts | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Solidity | `-` | contracts | contracts | witness | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **sutra** (COBOL): the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.
- **trebago** (FORTRAN): the pillar (FORTRAN): exact numerics. 'trebago <entry>' then 'in  <args>' / 'out <result>' / assignments / 'end'. Integer only; sums via sum(i, expr).
- **eve** (Ada): the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.
- **kron** (APL): the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.
- **myra** (MUMPS): the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.
- **algol60** (ALGOL 60): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier
- **-** (Haskell): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- "ready to sign" = every clause agreed by every party (the party matrix all TRUE) in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed
- obligations per party per due date in minor units in COBOL as Sutra + FORTRAN as Trebago witnessed
- payment schedule (instalment n = floor(total x n / N) minus paid) in FORTRAN as Trebago + COBOL as Sutra witnessed
- clause limits (at most 16 parties, clause text at most 8192 bytes) in Ada as Eve
- party matrix (party by clause, four values) in APL as KRON
- clause tree in MUMPS as MYRA

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `difference` | num | `a b` | trebago | `check difference a=10,5,0,100 b=3,5,0,99 = 7,0,0,1` |
| `limit_excess` | num | `value limit` | trebago | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
| `count_ok` | truth | `count max` | kron | `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 max=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false` |
| `product` | num | `a b` | sutra | `check product a=1,12,0,999 b=1250,999,7,1000 = 1250,11988,0,999000` |
