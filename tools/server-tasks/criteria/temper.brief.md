# temper — the complete brief

## Purpose

the companion's feeling (`companion.mood`), the swarm's budgets and cycles (`swarm.state`), its earnings in the books (`swarm.earnings`), energy budgets (`power.budget`).

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `swarm`
- `ledger.read`
- `notify`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | arrays | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | limits | primary | runs |
| Mojo | `-` | ai | AI | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| COBOL | `sutra` | money | money and ledgers | primary | runs |
| C++ | `cpp` | money | money and ledgers | witness | runs (compiled to wasm) |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **kron** (APL): the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.
- **eve** (Ada): the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.
- **-** (Mojo): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier
- **sutra** (COBOL): the pillar (COBOL): records and procedures. A record with PIC pictures, then 'procedure division.' with COMPUTE and IF. A value that does not fit its picture is refused, never cut.
- **cpp** (C++): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- an amount in Zeckendorf form over the D1-D9 faces in sutra + C++ wasm + kron witnessed against kernel/src/swarm/swarm_denom.h
- octane grade from the largest face (PLAIN 0, REGULAR 4, MIDGRADE 9, PREMIUM 14, RACING 23, MAX 63) in eve + kron witnessed
- budget shares per agent from the swarm_shares block (`use swarm_shares 1`)
- budget record in myra
- Mutual-aid words only (a grant, an allotment). Budget changes are the owner's

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `product` | num | `a b` | sutra | `check product a=1,12,0,999 b=1250,999,7,1000 = 1250,11988,0,999000` |
| `grade_band` | num | `value b1 b2 b3 b4` | kron | `check grade_band value=0,5,15,25,100 b1=10,b2=20,b3=30,b4=40 = 0,0,1,2,4` |
| `limit_excess` | num | `value limit` | trebago | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
| `share_x100` | num | `part whole` | kron | `check share_x100 part=1,1,1,50 whole=3,4,100,100 = 3333,2500,100,5000` |
| `composite_key` | num | `high low` | myra | `check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999` |
