# kitling — the complete brief

## Purpose

the companion's DNA, mood and generation (`companion.dna`, `companion.mood`, `companion.generation`), talk (`swarm.ask`), the swarm's state (`swarm.state`).

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `swarm`
- `ai.ask`
- `notify`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| APL | `kron` | arrays | arrays | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | limits | limits | primary | runs |
| Mojo | `-` | ai | AI | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Occam | `-` | concurrency | concurrency | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Clojure | `-` | symbolic | symbolic reasoning | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **kron** (APL): the pillar (APL/K): exact array arithmetic as ONE expression line '<first-row-answer>|<expr with _arg names>'. Multiply, modulus, comparisons, min/max only. No floats.
- **eve** (Ada): the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.
- **-** (Mojo): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- growth stage from generation in eve + kron witnessed
- Fibonacci charge in Zeckendorf form for display in fortran77 + basic + zlir witnessed against swarm_denom.h
- trait strengths from the 8 genes in kron
- memory record in myra
- The companion never spends past the owner's budget and never moves money

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ratio_x1000` | num | `num den` | kron | `check ratio_x1000 num=1,1,1,3 den=3,8,1000,4 = 333,125,1,750` |
| `composite_key` | num | `high low` | myra | `check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999` |
| `limit_excess` | num | `value limit` | trebago | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
| `running_state` | truth | `state event` | kron | `check running_state state=0,0,1,1 event=1,2,1,2 = true,false,true,false` |
