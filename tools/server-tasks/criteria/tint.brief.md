# tint — the complete brief

| wave spec | `wave11/138-tint.md` |

## Purpose

colour filters for colour blindness, greyscale, invert, more contrast, fewer flashes. zxvd has no display-filter method (`ui.set` changes simple mode only): use only existing methods; list what's missing in your report.

## Capabilities (the exact registry names for `needs`)

- `sys.read`

## The language map: which language owns which component

| language | runtime | owns | feature | role | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | `c` | view | view and model | primary | runs |
| Ada | `eve` | safety | safety rules | primary | runs |
| MUMPS | `myra` | records | records | primary | runs |
| Natural | `-` | query | queries | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Icon | `-` | pattern | patterns | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |
| Raku | `-` | parse | parsing | primary | planned: needs Lingua front-end |

## The runtime rules (how each named runtime's source must look)

- **c** (C): the host tier: C11, zero-malloc, fixed buffers, exact integers. The view and model layer; reaches the system through the C ABI.
- **eve** (Ada): the pillar (Ada): ranges and limits. A package line 'eve <app>', domain declarations '<name> = <lo> .. <hi>', and blocks '<block> { <arg>: <domain> <lo> .. <hi> }'. It declares what is allowed; it cannot compute.
- **myra** (MUMPS): the pillar (MUMPS): records and indexes. One global line '^<GLOBAL>(<arg>:<pic>, ...) = <field>:<pic>! ...'. The pics are the field widths; the index is the first key.
- **-** (Natural): see docs/LANGUAGE_CATALOGUE.md for this tier

## The spec's Logic clauses (what each component computes)

- flash guard (at most 3 flashes a second, large bright changes held) in eve + kron witnessed
- intensity limits 0..100 in eve
- filter matrix applied (3x3 integer q12, clamped 0..255) in kron
- preset record (name, matrix, intensity) in myra

## The entries and their exact checks

| entry (pattern) | kind | args | language | exact check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `count_ok` | truth | `count max` | kron | `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 max=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false` |
| `limit_excess` | num | `value limit` | trebago | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |
| `clamp` | num | `value min max` | kron | `check clamp value=-5,0,50,150 min=0,0,0,0 max=100,100,100,100 = 0,0,50,100` |
| `composite_key` | num | `high low` | myra | `check composite_key high=2024,0,1,999 low=7,0,999,999 = 2024007,0,1999,999999` |
