## Clauses the pattern library does not yet cover (author these)

- - `binding_ok`: (critical) "binding" (every party signed the same text version AND every clause reading agreed AND ratified by each party's declared rule) in Ada as Eve + APL as KRON witnessed
- - `parties`: party hierarchy in MUMPS as MYRA
- never re-derive the tables
