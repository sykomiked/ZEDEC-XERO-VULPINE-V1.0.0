| - (critical) litres from meter pulses (pulses x ml per pulse | `count_ok` | truth | `count,max` | eve, kron | true when 0 < count <= max (the registry's law) | `check count_ok count=1,100,101,0 max=100,100,100,100 = true,true,false,false` |
| - pressure limits (kPa range) in Ada as Eve | `limit_excess` | num | `value,limit` | trebago, eve | 0 when value <= limit, else value - limit (the ceiling's excess) | `check limit_excess value=0,1000,1001,2000 limit=1000,1000,1000,1000 = 0,0,1,1000` |

## Clauses the pattern library does not yet cover (author these)

- - flow model (litres per period, night window) exact in FORTRAN as Trebago
- - pipe matrix (pipes x valves x fixtures) in APL as KRON
- - fixture tree in MUMPS as MYRA
- - Forth and BASIC blocks are committed in twin form: the manifest's logic line names the twin (`logic cairndrake ...`, `logic hatchling ...`)
- never re-derive the tables
